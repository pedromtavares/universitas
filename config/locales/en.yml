      tip_text: "Feel free to upload as many documents as you please, but be aware that these will be available to anyone on the web to download."
    group_documents:
      tip: Group document senders
      tip_text: "Each group document has a sender, which was the member who originally shared it with the group. Keeping track of these more active members might be a good idea."
      tip2: Group document actions
      tip2_text: "On the group document tables, you can quickly accept/remove a document, edit its module or check out its sender through the little action icons on the right."
      tip3: Adding group documents
      tip3_text: "Every document you add to the group will be automatically accepted. If you already own a document and wish to add it to the group, use the sharing UI on the group's page instead to avoid having duplicate documents associated with your account."
    groups:
      tip: As a Group Member
      tip_text: "You can share documents with the group, promote the group with a message to all your followers and post in the group forums. All documents shared with the group has to be approved by the Group Leader, so if you share a document and it doesn't immediately show up on the group document list, be patient."
      tip2: As a Group Leader
      tip2_text: "You can edit the group's information (including module information), accept or decline documents that were shared with the group, update the group's status (this update will appear on all members' dashboard) and edit/moderate the group forums. Group leaders can, obviously, also do everything group members do."
      tip3: Sharing documents with a group
      tip3_text: "To share documents you already own, use the search box to find the specific documents you want to share and click the '+' icon. After you're done, select the target group module (or leave it blank if you want) and click 'Save'. On the other hand, if you want to upload a new document on the fly, click the 'Create' button and fill out the form. On both cases, the document will be sent to the group leader for approval."
    registrations:
      tip: Importance of a real e-mail address
      tip_text: "Make sure you supply your real e-mail address so that we can send account recovery instructions, which could happen case you forget your password, or if your chosen sign in option (Facebook or Twitter) token expires."
      tip2: Import personal data from Twitter/Facebook
      tip2_text: "You can import your personal data from Twitter/Facebook like your picture, location, bio, e-mail and website by adding them as sign in options. Links to your profiles in these services will also be added automatically."
    user_documents:
      tip: About Uploaded Documents

    users:
      tip: Following users
      tip_text: "After following a user, you will receive updates on your dashboard regarding actions about that user such as when he/she adds a document, joins a group, updates status, etc."

    what: What is Universitas?
    faq: Frequently Asked Questions
    what_text: "In a nutshell, Universitas is a Google Groups on steroids. It's a more social and collaborative approach to groups, where you get to more actively keep track of what's going on in groups you're interested in, along with being able to contribute with them directly by sharing your own documents and ideas. Oh, it's all free too."
    signup: Not comfortable signing up?
    signup_text: "No problem! Universitas is meant to be a free and open platform, be our guest and browse freely through our user, group and document databases (you can download any document you want too!) by navigating the top menu and when you're ready for a more thorough experience, <a href='/users/sign_up'>become a member</a>."
    features: Features
    doc: Document Upload and Sharing
    doc_text: "One of the purposes in Universitas is to hold a huge document database, so you as a user can upload as many documents as you want and have your own document collection to share with other people or other groups."
    dash: Dashboard Updates and Internal Network
    dash_text: "Say you have some colleagues or people you admire who are also in Universitas, you probably would want to know if they've engaged in a new group or if they uploaded a new document. For that reason the platform has an internal Twitter-like social network, where you can follow other people and get updates on your dashboard referring not only to the people you follow, but to the groups you're in as well. You can also keep up with a user or group's update feed just by visiting their page." 
    group: Simple Yet Powerful Groups
    group_text: "Universitas' groups have an easy-to-use, yet powerful user interface. You start by getting a very friendly URL for your group, such as universit.as/mygroup that you can easily share across the web. You can also nest various different subjects on your group into separated modules, each with their own document collection."
    group_text2: "Sharing documents with groups is as easy as selecting them from your own collection and adding them to the group's collection, or you can just upload them directly from the same place. As a group leader, you get to manage every single document that comes in through a similar and instinctive UI."
    forum: Group Forums
    forum_text: "The most important thing related to groups is discussion: what's the point in having groups if you can't exchange thoughts and ideas? In Universitas, each group gets its very own forum (or message board, if you will), where the group leader can create (and moderate) as many sections as he wants and the members can create topics and posts about basically anything they wish to share."
    unlimited: "Unlimited document upload? Seriously?"
    unlimited_text: "Yes. You can store as many files as you want, as long as their types are allowed (documents and images)."
    who: Who is Universitas for?
    who_text: "People interested in learning new things and in sharing their knowledge. Maybe you want to learn something and don't know where to start, or maybe you have a ton of interesting material about something and would like a central place for it all so other people could come and get interested as well. Heck, even if you just got a study group and need a place to put all your research in and discuss it."
    get: "What do I get when I sign up?"
    get_text: "You get to upload documents, to join groups, post in forums and to see updates in your dashboard. The most you do as a guest is search our databases and download documents, which is fine too, but signing up takes like 30 seconds and gets you full access to the system, making those 30 seconds quite worthwhile."
    social: "Yet another social network? Geez."
    social_text: "No, Universitas' network is far from having the same personal-life focus purpose of Facebook nor the micro-blogging purpose of Twitter, or at least that's not what it was meant for. Aside from the status update, the updates system is restricted to Universitas' features only, like joining a group or creating a document, and so is the focus of its network."

    about: About Universitas
    about_text: "Universitas is originally an open source side project of mine. Open source means that all the source code needed to create this website is <a href='http://github.com/pedromtavares/universitas'>open to the public</a> (developers, more likely) and side project means that nobody is paying me to work on this, I just do it to experiment new things (technology wise) and to possibly be responsible for something useful to a lot of people."
    about2: And who are you?
    about2_text: "My name is <a href='http://pedromtavares.com'>Pedro Mateus Tavares</a> and I'm a software developer. I am currently the only person behind Universitas, having developed it all by myself and also the one pays all its bills (server and file storage)."
    about3: Don't you need help?
    about3_text: "Yes. Keeping Universitas up to date with new features and fixing eventual bugs consumes time, it took me more than 6 months to launch the initial version because I simply didn't have the time to do it sooner. If you are a developer or a designer and would like to help out, please send me an e-mail or contact me through the form on this page, I will be making an official 'please help me' blog post with more technical details about the project and will update this page with it as soon as it's done."
